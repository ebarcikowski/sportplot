# Summary

A toy project that plots a few interesting pieces of data, read
from a Garmin GPX file.

I created this mostly to try out making plots using the Altair project and
Vegas which I have always thought may be a nice alternative to plotly. In
the process I wrote a small Flask based page that renders webpage with
a single day of cycling data.

I have always wanted to create a simple alternative to things like
Strava or Training Peaks, as I never seem to be able to display the
data that I really want with them. Perhaps I'll continue this and create
that, but there's a long ways to go!
